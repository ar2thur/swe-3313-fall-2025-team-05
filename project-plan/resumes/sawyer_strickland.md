#### RELEVANT PROJECT EXPERIENCE

###### Immersive Engine - May 2025 - Present

• Created a component based game engine in C++.

• Engineered a real-time 3D renderer that utilizes the OpenGL API, implementing Phong lighting through

custom written shaders.

• Added VR support by integrating OpenXR, allowing for support of most headsets and their inputs.

• Serves as the base for future plans in developing a VR editor that employs a skeuomorphic approach to

development. This will allow for a more intuitive and user-friendly creation of VR applications.

###### Immersive Empathic Interface (IEI) Lab: VR Classroom - October 2024 - Present

• Developed a VR note taking system in Unreal Engine 5 for a larger VR classroom project in association

with the Kennesaw State University Office of Undergraduate Research.

• Augmented the note taking process through the use of the Logitech MX Ink stylus.

• Performed a study where participants utilized the system to take notes over a lecture and were later tested on

their knowledge. This helped determine the correlation between motor skills, retention, and learning

outcomes.
