## Experience
### Artificial Intelligence Testing @ NCUR  
*Kennesaw State University – Atlanta, GA*  
**Jan. 2025 – Apr. 2025**  
Developed software test suite capable of validating reasoning and factuality of LLMs
- Generates 500+ tests to score LLM models on all popular industry benchmarks  
- Validated benchmarks for tokenization, reasoning, factuality, and pattern recognition  
- Software auto-generates and formats questions to avoid bias and overfitting  
- Results proved that popular LLM models are overfit to AI benchmarks like MMLU and GSM8K
