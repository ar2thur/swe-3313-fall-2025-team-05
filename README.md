# Introduction
Weâ€™re building a demo e-commerce site using Python, Flask, and SQLite with Jinja2 templates and DaisyUI for styling. The site showcases aerospace (missiles and weapons) that users can browse and add to a cart. The team is focusing on clean routing, secure user authentication, order fulfillment, and a responsive UI.
