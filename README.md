# Introduction
We’re building a demo e-commerce site using Python, Flask, and SQLite with Jinja2 templates and DaisyUI for styling. The site showcases aerospace (missiles and weapons) that users can browse and add to a cart. The team is focusing on clean routing, secure user authentication, order fulfillment, and a responsive UI.

### Team Assignments
- Our team is divided into 5 roles: technical lead, project design manager, full-stack developer, front-end developer, and back-end developer.
- See [here](./project-plan/team-assignments/README.md) for the assignment of these roles.

### Technology Selection
- For our application, we will be coding in Python and using Flask as our webserver. We will use a SQLite database to store all of our data.
- See [here](./project-plan/technology-selection/README.md) for a full explanation of what we are using and why.

# Requirements
After carefully reviewing the customer's notes, we have collected a list of requirements detailing what they expect from the product. We then sorted these into their must haves, needs to haves, and wants to haves. From that, we were able to create a use case diagram, decision table, and sample implementation of each condition.

See [here](./requirements/README.md) for the detailed list of the requirements from the customer for version 1 and version 2.

### Use Case Diagram
See [here](./requirements/use-case.md) for a detailed use case diagram.

### Decision Table
See [here](./requirements/decision-table.md) for the decision tables as well as a code sample for all conditions in version 1 of the product.
